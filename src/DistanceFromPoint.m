% @input: curve is an array with parameter of a Fat BÃ¨zier curve
%         point is an array with point coordinates
%         eps is the desidered precision: it is assured that the distance returned is
%             at most eps far from the real distance
% @output: d is the square of the distance between point and curve
%          p is an array with minimal point coordinates
